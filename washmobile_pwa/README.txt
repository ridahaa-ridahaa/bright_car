WashMobile PWA demo
-------------------

This is a small Progressive Web App (PWA) demo to simulate the WashMobile app.

How to use:
1. Download and unzip the package.
2. Host the folder on any static hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or your own server).
3. Open the site in a mobile browser; you can install it to your home screen.
4. To generate an Android APK from this PWA:
   - Use https://pwabuilder.com (enter your site URL) to generate an Android package.
   - Or use Google's Bubblewrap tool (advanced).
5. Bookings are saved in the browser localStorage as a demo.

Note: For production, replace localStorage with real backend API calls to your server.
